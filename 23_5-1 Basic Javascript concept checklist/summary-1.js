                                What have we learned in Milestone - 4?

** JavaScript is a 'high-level, interpreted programming language'. It makes the web pages more 'interactive,.We can use JavaScript to make 'animation'.

** Variable is like a box that store things. There are five types of variables 'number, string, boolean, null and undefined'.

** JavaScript keywords are 'reserved' words and they cannot be used as variable name and function name.

** 'Camel Case, Snake Case and Pascal Case' are the three most common naming conventions.

** Variable names are case sensitive.

** We discussed 'four' types of mathematical operations: 'addition, subtraction, multiplication and 'division (+, -, *, /)'.

** Shorthand mathematical operations (+=, -=, *=, /=, ++, --).

** We can join two strings together using the 'concatenation operator, +'.

** Using the 'modulus operator, %', we can find the remainder of a division.

** parseInt and parseFloat:

    parseInt:                            parseFloat:
    string to int                       string to float
    '20' ---> 20                        '20.13' ---> 20.13

** Typeof
'typeof' is a JavaScript keyword that will return the type of variable.

var massage = 'Hello Coders!';
console.log(typeof message);
// Output: string


** Array in JavaScript:

const salad = ['Tomato', 'Mushroom', 'Broccoli', 'Cucumber', 'Lettuce', 'Carrot', 'Avocado'];
Element at index0 is Tomato
Element at index1 is Mushroom
Element at index2 is Broccoli
Element at index3 is Cucumber
Element at index4 is Lettuce
Element at index5 is Carrot
Element at index6 is Avocado

const number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
