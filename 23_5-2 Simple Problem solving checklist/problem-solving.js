Question 1: Feet to inch, 'feetToInch'. You must name the function exactly as it is written here. How many inches are in 15 feet?

Question 2: Centimeter to Meter, 'centimeterToMeter'. You must name the function exactly as it is written here. How much is 1000 centimeters in meters and  It will only return the number, how much is it?

Question 3. Count Paper, 'paperRequirements'. You must name the function exactly as it is written here. You are given 3 parameters:
Count Paper:
book1: 100 pages
book2: 200 pages
book3: 300 pages

That is, it will take three parameters. 
* With the first parameter you will indicate that, How many copies of the first book do you want? for first I want 50 copies.
* The second parameter is that, How many copies of book number two do you want? for the second I want 20 books.
* The third parameter is that, How many copies of book number three do you want? for the third I want 14 books.
How much paper will I need overall for this three books You need to find out?
/ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- /

Question:
You must write a function named 'paperRequirements' exactly as written. The function will take three parameters representing the number of copies required for three books. The page counts for each book are fixed as follows:

* Book 1: 100 pages
* Book 2: 200 pages
* Book 3: 300 pages

Input:
* The first parameter represents how many copies of Book 1 are needed.
* The second parameter represents how many copies of Book 2 are needed.
* The third parameter represents how many copies of Book 3 are needed.

Example:
If you need 50 copies of Book 1, 20 copies of Book 2, and 14 copies of Book 3, how much paper is required in total?

Output:
Calculate and return the total number of pages needed to print all the requested copies of the three books.

Question 4: There will be many names in one array. For example ['Hasan', 'Jamal', 'Mohammad Yousuf', 'Mizan', 'Jubayer Bin Rasheed', 'Mamun', 'Kamal',]; . So your job is to write a function that does this 'bestFriend' and Return the name that is the largest among them. You must name the function exactly as it is written here which is 'bestFriend'.

Question 5: There will be an array, it will have many numbers in it and there will be positive and negative numbers. For example [45, 87, 96, 11, 63, -56, 71, 28]; . If a negative number ever comes up, the loop will stop at that point and It will return all the numbers found until it is stops. You have to declare a function which is 'onlyPositive'. 
* You will pass an array like this as an input parameter to a function.
* After this, your task will be to take each element from this array until, when you get a negative number which has a value less than 0, then you have to stop the loop immediately, then all the elements found so far, you will return them as an array.
